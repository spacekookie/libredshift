libredshift
===========

This is a redshift fork that allows anyone to use it's functionality like a library instead of a binary application. It also uses a different build system and only supports modern linux distributions (tested on Arch).

This library was created for [redshift ctrl](https://github.com/spacekookie/redshift_ctrl).


### If you want to use this library

Great. Let me know if you have any issues building with cmake or linking against it.


### If you want to improve the build system support of this library

Great! Right now it only builds on Linux and I have nothing else to test it with. So get those PR's coming :)


### If you want to improve the source code of this library

Don't! Contribute to [UPSTREAM](https://github.com/jonls/redshift) instead and let me pull their changes. Then we can all work on hacking around autotools to make it build again :)
